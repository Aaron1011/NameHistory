# NameHistory

With Minecraft name change support now on the horizon, many users will be facing a problem:

> How do I identify my friends who've changed their names?

NameHistory is here to help!

## What is it?

NameHistory is a plugin for both Sponge **and** Bukkit servers, which allows you to easily discover the names a player previously had.

NameHistory allows you to see:
* A player's full name history
* A player's most recent name
* Verify whether a player ever had a given name

For convienence, lookups can be done using the player's current name (or UUID, if you prefer).
